# Tic Tac Toe 🤪🎮

Welcome to the greatest game in the universe! It's X vs O. It's fast. It's furious. It’s the battle of wits where no one really wins, but everyone has a good time pretending to care. 😎

## How to Play:
1. Pick your fighter: X or O. Choose wisely, my friend. ✨
2. Take turns slapping your mark onto the board (no slapping in real life, please). 🖐️
3. Get three marks in a row, and BOOM, you're a genius! 🔥
4. If nobody gets three in a row, it’s a draw... kinda like that one time you tried to bake cookies and ended up with something that wasn't quite cookies. 🍪

## Features:
- Lightning-fast gameplay, like you’re competing with a squirrel on a sugar rush. 🐿️💨
- No instructions needed (because honestly, who doesn’t know Tic Tac Toe by now?). 🙃
- If you lose, no worries, try again! We all need a second chance in life. 💯

## Why Play?
Because why NOT? It’s simple, silly, and guarantees at least 5 seconds of entertainment before you start arguing about who really won. 🙃🤡
